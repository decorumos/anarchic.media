# News for you, the one's who will change the world.
> "Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes ... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. ... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. ... They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do." Steve Jobs, 1997

## At Anarchic.Media we believe in the future and in the individuals ability to change the world.

### We started anarchic for one reason. To return the mic to the makers, the builders, the thinkers and the basement philosophers. Let's make change, unite and bring a better future. Together.
